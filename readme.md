# PirAtE Documentation

The PirAtE Documentation is done with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). It converts Markdown files to a static Website, which can be used as Project Documentation.

Our static Project Documentation for PirAtE can be found under https://ch3ri0ur.github.io/piratedocs/.

The Documentation Builds it self on the Github, if changes were made.


## Run mkdocs Local

A Local installation for the compiling is done with Python. The following Python Programms/Plugins are needed:

    pip install mkdocs

    pip install mkdocs-material

    pip3 install mkdocs-exclude

    pip install pymdown-extensions

    pip install mkdocs-roamlinks-plugin

Now you can just run MkDocs and Display the Website in the Own Browser.

    mkdocs serve

It will update each time automatically when changing files.

## Miscellaneous

The Folder Misc Contains some Formatting Examples and some Formatting Tests we have done.
