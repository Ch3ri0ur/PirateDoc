    - dynamic variables memory
    - global variables memory
    - program code
- low time usage
    - almost no blocking / active waiting
    - max time of actions can be defined
    - low processing time
- simple to use
    - just a few functions
    - basic configuration available
    - website generates automatically from code
- consistent
    - stable, no breaks
    - mostly data lost free
    - predictable behavior
    - self fixing, restart
