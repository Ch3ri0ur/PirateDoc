# Overview Pirate Hook

The Pirate Hook hooks into the Arduino program of the user and provides functionality for the data transfer from and to the [Pirate Flag](../Pirate-Flag/00-flag.md) over the [Pirate Bridge](../Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md).

The communication uses the [Pirate Serial Protocol](pirate-serial-protocol.md) that was created for this project. The protocol is kept simple and is focused on reducing the effort on the Arduino side. The thinking is mostly exported on the [Pirate Bridge](../Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md) side.

Pirate Hook uses a serial connection of the [Arduino's](Theory/arduino.md) to transmit and receive data by the protocol. In the current implementation only Serial communication over UART/USB is supported.
