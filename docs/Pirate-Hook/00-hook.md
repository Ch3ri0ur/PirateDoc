# Overview Pirate Hook

The Pirate Hook hooks into the Arduino program of the user and provides functionality for the data transfer from and to the [Pirate Flag](../Pirate-Flag/00-flag.md) over the [Pirate Bridge](../Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md).

Pirate Hook uses a serial connection of the [Arduino's](Theory/arduino.md) to transmit and receive data. 
In the current implementation only Serial communication over UART/USB is supported.
