# Overview Pirate Hook

The Pirate Hook hooks into the Arduino program of the user and implements the data transfer from and to the [[Pirate Flag]].

Its Implementation is focused on this aspects:

- low memory usage
    - dynamic variables
    - global variables
    - program code
- low time usage
    - almost no blocking
    - max time of actions can be defined
    - no parsing, just raw data
- simple to use
    - just a few functions
    - only 3 needed Stages
        1. Start Communication (Setup)
        2. Define variables (Setup)
        3. Perform Send & Receive (Main Loop)
    - website is automatically generated

The low memory and time usage aspect are partly the reason, why many functions are just macros, that get optimized by the compiler.
