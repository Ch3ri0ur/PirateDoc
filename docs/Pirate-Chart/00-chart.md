# Pirate Chart Overview

The Chart is the umbrella term for the signaling and route finding of this project. It encompasses:

[Getting Started](10-chart-getting-started.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Requirements

* A reverse proxy to unify the endpoints of the pirate module.
    * ensuring secure connection via HTTPS
        * This necessitates a domain and certificate.
        * The domain needs to be registered via DNS.
* A method to point users to the possible projects and route the queries above the reverse proxies of the individual moduls.

[Requirements](20-chart-requirements.md){: .md-button  }

## Implementation

For the reverse proxy, needed to unify the endpoints, a server implementation called [[caddy]] is used. It takes all requests to the Bridge, Flag and the Spyglass and directs them to the correct components. It also provides a secure [[HTTP]]S connection for all clients.
