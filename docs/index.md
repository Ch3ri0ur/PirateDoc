# Pirate Overview
Pirate (short for Pirate implements remote access to experiments) is a remote monitoring solution for Arduino projects.

## Overview
When integrated into an Arduino project variables can be designated to be sent or received. These then get periodically transmitted via UART to an application on a connected Raspberry PI, the Pirate-Bridge. This Bridge uses the data to provide an SSE-Stream. The Pirate-Client reads this stream and displays the data. It can in turn sent requests to the Pirate-Bridge to change variables on the Arduino. Parallel to this the Raspberry PI can also provide a live view of the project, via a Raspberry PI Camera and WebRTC.


Components:

+ Arduino
    + Project
    + Pirate-Ardu-Lib
+ Raspberry PI
    + Pirate-Bridge for routing the data
    + Webcam
    + Janus-Gateway to serve the WebRTC camera stream
    + Webserver to serve Pirate-Client
+ Server
    + Routing to the different projects but also encapsulation
