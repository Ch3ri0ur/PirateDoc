# Pirate Overview
Pirate (short for "Pirate Implements Remote Access to Experiments") is a remote monitoring solution for Arduino projects.

## Motivation

When using an Arduino there are a lot of pain points. Pirate looks to solve a few of them:

* Reading variables
    * is often done by printing them via Serial.Print to a console.
        * String handling is slow and might influence cycle time. 
        * The data scrolls by to fast to be useful.
    * If a display is used the available space is to little to be very useful.
* Changing parameters 
    * often entails changing them in the source, recompiling and flashing again.
    * Alternatively additional hardware can be used to do that manually.
* Extracting data
* Monitoring the project from a distance.

Pirate looks to be a solution to provide an realtime Interface where the variables and parameters can be monitored and changed on the fly. While doing that it also strives to have as little impact on cycle performance as possible.

## Overview
When integrated into an Arduino project via the [Pirate Hook](Pirate-Hook/00-hook.md) variables can be designated to be sent or received. These then get periodically transmitted via UART to the [Pirate Bridge](Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md) on a connected Raspberry PI. The Bridge uses the data to provide an [interface](Pirate-Bridge/client-facing-interface.md) for the clients. The standard client is called [Pirate Flag](Pirate-Flag/00-flag.md). It reads data streams from the interface and displays the data in a webpage. It can in turn send requests to the [Pirate Bridge](Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md) to change parameters on the Arduino. Parallel to this the Raspberry PI can also provide a live view of the project with [Pirate Spyglass](Pirate-Spyglass/00-spyglass.md).

## Getting Started:

To get started a set of setup instructions are provided:

[Hook into the Arduino](./Pirate-Hook/10-hook-getting-started.md)

[Setup the Raspberry PI](setupraspberrypi.md)

[Install the Bridge](./Pirate-Bridge/10-bridge-getting-started.md)

[Use Pirate to Control and Monitor your Project](Pirate-Flag/10-flag-getting-started.md)

[Add a camera to your Project](Pirate-Spyglass/10-spyglass-getting-started.md)

[Extra credit: Set up DNS / Domain for remote Access](Pirate-Map/10-map-getting-started.md) 


<!-- ## Components

The project is designed to be run on a Raspberry PI 4. And to interface with an Arduino.

Necessary Components:

* Arduino + Cable
* Raspberry PI 4 + Charger
* Ethernet - Connection + Cable -->



## [[Architecture]]:


- [Hook: Arduino Plugin](Pirate-Hook/00-hook.md)
- [Bridge: Connects to Arduino and Serves API](Pirate-Bridge/00-bridge.md)
- [Flag: Interface for Monitoring and Controlling](Pirate-Flag/00-flag.md)
- [Spyglass: Enables a Webcam view](Pirate-Spyglass/00-spyglass.md)


<!-- New image make components out of bridge and spyglass and no raspberry for flag -->

<!-- The project is 

+ Arduino
    + Project
    + Pirate-Ardu-Lib
+ Raspberry PI
    + Pirate-Bridge for routing the data
    + Webcam
    + Janus-Gateway to serve the WebRTC camera stream
    + Webserver to serve Pirate-Client
