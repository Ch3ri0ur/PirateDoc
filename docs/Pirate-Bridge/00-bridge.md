[Getting Started](10-bridge-getting-started.md){: .md-button .md-button--primary }

## Requirements
In this section an overview of the necessary functions are provided.

* Managing the connection with the Pirate Hook on the connected Arduino
* Serving the API 
    * Sending the project data 
    * Receiving and forwarding control commands
* Serving the client website

## Implementation

The Bridge is foremost a [[nodejs]] application which reads the serial port on the Raspberry PI and broadcasts the information to all connected clients. (more about this interface here: [HTTP Interface](client-facing-interface.md)). 

When polled the Bridge will supply the Arduino with the values the clients sent to it. 

It also serves the static content of the Pirate Flag.
