The overall Goals are defined below. Further and more specific requirements can be found in each components section.

## User Stories
* As a User I want to be able to see the status of my project in realtime on a graph.
* As a User I want to be able to download the shown graph data.
* As a User I want to be able to influence the variables/parameters directly without reflashing the Arduino.
* As a User I want to be able to access the the dashboard from "anywhere".
* When controlling a project from a remote location I as a User want to view a live feed of the project to monitor the actual influence my action have.
* As a User I want to easily be able to set up this solution.
