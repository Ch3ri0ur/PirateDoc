# License Types

## Copyright

Copyright isn't a License, it's about who owns/created the software code (intellectual property) and can decide about distribution and right to copy. A Copyright holder can give permission to others to use it or transfer the Copyright Ownership.
A Copyright always exists, even if the Author didn't add an Copyright Quote.

The Owner of the Copyright can give others permission to use the code by adding a Quote, there they allow others to do it.
Legal documents for giving someone the right to contribute are Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and to transfer ownership of the copyright are Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA).

Most License for OpenSource Software or Free Software force the Owner to allow others of getting free Copy of Sourcecode to study or modify. This doesn't mean that the Code looses its copyright or is free of charge to use.

A Copyright Quote mustn't be removed or modified! It is usually acceptable to move the Quote to a more Central location or when a file gets split up, to duplicate it in each file.

When someone else modifies a work (with allowance) the new code and changes fall under a new copyright with the modifier as owner. This doesn't mean that the old copyright is replaced, but that all changes are protected by an new one. 
A Copyright Quote for the Modification can be added to the file/section or listed under the original Copyright Quote with or without a description what changes have been introduced. In versioning tools all changes get tracked and it can be easily seen who did which changes. Adding a Date/Year to the copyright helps to keep track.
The Copyrights can be combined if the owner of the original work allows it to become a combined work, but often it will stay a separate copyright for the modified/added work with the new author as owner. This means this modified work now needs the agreement of all the owners of the existing copyrights to be distributed and copied. Partial Copy or Distribution of only code that is under copyright of one owner would of course only need the one owners agreement.

There are two maintaining methods for maintaining copyright notices.

- File-scope copyright notices mean the copyright is managed for every File. This way its much easier to see which Copyrights exist for the code in the file, but is also makes it much harder to track everything and keep it up to data.
- Centralized copyright notices gets managed in one file in the top level of the Project. The copyright quote should be updated with specific information about the work each contributor did. This hasn't to be done and in versioning tools like Github it is easy to track down which Code is made by who.

If all Codeparts/intellectual Property of an Copyright Owner have been replaced/removed, than the copyright quote of this person can be removed. But it is very difficult to be sure and often you still need to credit the creator for the idea or inspiration.

## Copyleft

Copyleft is a rule that shall prevent others to redistributed the program (with or without modification) with a restrictions on the central freedom of free Software. This means a project that inherits/includes a project with a copyleft rule needs to contain this rule from now in ist onw rules. 

Many OpenSource Licenses come with a Copyleft rule included, which is for protecting the project to become closed source, taking away the freedom of free software and not crediting the work of the original authors.

## Free Software

Free Software means the software follows the rules of Freedom to run, study or modify the code and retribute it to others. This doesn't mean that this is free of charge but you got option do so if you want.

- Freedom to run means you don't have to communicate to the developer for what you want to use it.
- Freedom to study and modify the SourceCode means a way to access the SourceCode needs to be given any you are free to do changes.
- Freedom to redistribute the software without or with own changes, without needing to notify, ask or pay someone. But a license of free software can permit other ways of releasing/contributing it.
- This doesn't mean that you don't have to pay for obtaining a copy of the Program/Executable or SourceCode.

Software released unter a free software license needs to follow the rules a both.

## Open Source

Open Source isn't equal to Free Software and is defined by the Open Source Initiative. Open Source got more restriction than Free Software. But Free Software is not so loose defined and more focused on the Freedom for the user. Because of the Similarity do Programms with a License that follows OpenSource or FreeSoftware rules often fulfill both definitions.
