# License Types

## Copyright

Copyright isn't a License, it's about who owns/created the software code (intellectual property) and can decide about distribution and right to copy. A Copyright holder can give permission to others to use it or transfer the Copyright Ownership.
A Copyright always exists, even if the Author didn't add an Copyright Quote.

The Owner of the Copyright can give others permission to use the code by adding a Quote, there they allow others to do it.
Legal documents for giving someone the right to contribute are Contributor License Agreement (CLA) and to transfer ownership of the copyright are Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA).

Most License for OpenSource Software or Free Software force the Owner to allow others of getting free Copy of Sourcecode to study or modify. This doesn't mean that the Code looses its copyright or is free of charge to use.

A Copyright Quote mustn't be removed or modified! It is usually acceptable to move the Quote can be moved to a more Central location or when a file gets split up to duplicate it in each file.

When someone else modifies a work (with allowance) the new code and changes fall under a new copyright with the modifier as owner. This doesn't mean that the old copyright is replaced, but that all changes are protected by an new one. 
A Copyright Quote for the Modification can be added to the file/section or listed under the original Copyright Quote with or without a description what changes have been introduced. In versioning tools all changes get tracked and it can be easily seen who did which changes. Adding a Date/Year to the copyright helps to keep track.
The Copyrights can be combined if the owner of the original work allows it to become a combined work, but often it will stay a separate copyright for the modified/added work with the new author as owner. This means this modified work now needs the agreement of all the owners of the existing copyrights to be distributed and copied. Partial Copy or Distribution of only code that is under copyright of one owner would of course only need the one owners agreement.

If all Codeparts/intellectual Property of an Copyright Owner have been replaced/removed, than the copyright quote of this person can be removed. But it is very difficult to be sure and often you still need to credit the creator for the idea or inspiration.
