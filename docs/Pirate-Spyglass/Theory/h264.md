# H.264 
H.264 also known as Advanced Video Coding (AVC) or AVC1 is a video compression standard for full HD Video and Audio.\
The standard is defined in MPEG Part 10 (H.264) ISO/IEC 14496-10.


## Compression

The Compression of H.264 uses an algorithm that uses previous or following frames to decode the stream. The System uses I-Frames/Key-Frames that don't need any previous Information to be decoded, to initialize a Stream.

- Intra Coded Picture (I-Frame) 
- Predictive Coded Picture (P-Frame)
- Bidirectional Coded Picture (B-Frame)

An I-Frame gets send every x Frame to get an instantaneous decoding refresh (IDR). The Frame is needed to start the Stream and help to stabilize the video when packages get lost.\
When the picture in a video footage change to much the frames can also be corrupted, this will cause the video to glitch and a I-Frame is needed to get back on track.


## Profile and Level

The profile and the added constraints indicate properties of the bitstream and video to allow a decoder and player to recognize the requirements for decoding and displaying it. The level indicates the bitrate and the required decoder performance for the profile. 

The Codecs, Profile, Constraints and Level gets combined in on string following the Generic ISO BMFF syntax eg. "avc1.640028". Some Codes are much longer!
| codec | profile | constraints | level |
|-|-|-|-|
| avc1 | 0x64 | 0x00 | 0x28 |
| h264 | high | 0x00 | 4.0 |

|Profiles|code|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Base / Baseline|BP, 66, 0x42|Primarily for low-cost applications that require additional data loss robustness, this profile is used in some videoconferencing and mobile applications.|
|Extended|XP, 88, 0x58|Intended as the streaming video profile, this profile has relatively high compression capability and some extra tricks for robustness to data losses and server stream switching.|
|Main|MP, 77, 0x4D|This profile is used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts that use the MPEG-4 format as defined in the DVB standard.|
|High|HiP, 100, 0x64|The primary profile for broadcast and disc storage applications, particularly for high-definition television applications. This is the most commonly used profile. This Profile is also used in the default RPI Video Stream on /dev/video0 when H264 is selected as pixel format|
|More ...|eg. Hi444PP, 244, 0xF4|Different Constraints set and also some special Profile properties.|


|Levels|code|Maximum video bit rate (kbits/s)|
|-|-|-|
|...|...|...|
|3|30, 0x1E| 10,000 |
|3.1|31, 0x1F| 14,000 |
|3.2|31, 0x20| 20,000 |
|4|40, 0x28| 20,000 |
|4|41, 0x29| 50,000 |
|4|42, 0x2A| 50,000 |

## H263 and H265

H263 previous development and only focused on low bit rates for conferences with less motion in pictures. H264 reaches with its compression lower bitrates and better video quality.

H265 latest development also known as High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). It got a much better compression, almost doubled.
